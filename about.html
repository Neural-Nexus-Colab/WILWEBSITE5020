        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Empowering the Nation was established in 2022 in Johannesburg by
            Precious Radebe as an initiative to address the lack of formal
            education and upskilling opportunities for domestic workers and
            gardeners. Inspired by her parents and elderly relatives who never
            had the chance to advance their skills, Precious created this SME to
            offer both six-month learnerships and six-week short skills training
            programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting small, the organization has grown to serve hundreds of
            learners, focusing on practical, hands-on courses that align with
            everyday needs in households and gardens. By 2025, it has expanded
            its reach within Johannesburg, incorporating digital tools like a
            web page and mobile app to make information and registrations more
            accessible.
