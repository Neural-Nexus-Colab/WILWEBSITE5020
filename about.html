    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Empowering the Nation was established in 2022 in Johannesburg by Precious Radebe as an initiative to address the
        lack of formal education and upskilling opportunities for domestic workers and gardeners. Inspired by her
        parents and elderly relatives who never had the chance to advance their skills, Precious created this SME to
        offer both six-month learnerships and six-week short skills training programs. Starting small, the organization
        has grown to serve hundreds of learners, focusing on practical, hands-on courses that align with everyday needs
        in households and gardens.</p>
    <p>By 2025, it has expanded its reach within Johannesburg, incorporating digital tools like a web page and mobile
        app to make information and registrations more accessible.</p>
    <h2>Community Impact</h2>
    <h3>Local Partnerships</h3>
    <p>We collaborate with local businesses to ensure our training meets industry needs and to create employment
        opportunities for our graduates.</p>
    <h3>Sustainable Development</h3>
    <p>Our programs promote sustainable practices in all industries, contributing to environmental conservation and
        community well-being.</p>
    <h3>Community Outreach</h3>
    <p>We regularly organize free workshops and community events to share knowledge and skills with those who cannot
        afford formal education.</p>
